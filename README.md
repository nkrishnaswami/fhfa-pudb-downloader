> The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008 requires certain information be made publicly available. Sections 1126 and 1212 address the availability of a “public use database”.

> Data on mortgages acquired by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are regulated by FHFA, supplies mortgage lenders, planners, researchers, and housing advocates with information concerning the flow of mortgage credit and capital in America’s communities.

> The PUDB single-family data set includes detailed information such as the income, race, and gender of the borrower as well as the census tract location of the property, loan-to-value ratio, age of mortgage note, and affordability of the mortgage.  Both the single-family and multifamily data include indicators of whether the purchases are from “underserved” census tracts, as defined in terms of median income and minority percentage of population.  The Census Tract file includes information on the location of the property based on the 2010 Census.
